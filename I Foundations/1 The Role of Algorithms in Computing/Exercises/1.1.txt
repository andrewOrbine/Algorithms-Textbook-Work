  Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that 
  requires computing a convex hull.

    A real-world example that requires sorting is how a web search is ordered with the most 
    relavent results appearing first and least relavent appearing last.

  Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?

    Other measures of efficiency may include: cost and resources required.

1.1-3
  Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its 
  strengths and limitations.

    An Array is a data structure that is great for quickly inserting values, however 
    it may be slow to search for a value that is stored in an array without it's specific index.

  How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar?
  How are they different?

    These problems are similar because they are both concerned with finding the best path
    from a set of points. They are different because shortest-path does not cycle back to 
    its initial point whereas traveling-salesman with be a cycle starting from its initial
    point and is an NP-complete problem.

1.1-5
  Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do.
  Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.

    Only the best solution will do if the problem was to sort a list of transactions from least to greatest.
    An approximate solution would be the best path to take for a bike ride.
